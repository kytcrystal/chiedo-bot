Project for cloud engineering course

## Project Description

This is a project on creating a chatbot to find information on unibz website, regarding university details. 

There will be a simple web application where current students, prospective students and professors can ask questions and expect a reply of the answers. The web application as well as the backend infrastructure will be hosted on AWS. 

Hosting this web application on cloud allows for flexibility and scalability during high demand period, ie. when the university application period opens. 

This project aims to explore the following questions:
1. What are the possible approaches to implement the backend architecture?
2. How does the application scale and perform?
3. What are the most costly components in terms of time and price?
4. How does the application ensure reliability?
